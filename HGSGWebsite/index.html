                                     <p>Venture capital is money that is given to help build new start-ups that are considered

                                        to have both high-growth and high-risk potential. Fast-growth companies with an exit

                                        strategy already in place can gain up to tens of millions of dollars that can be used to

                                        invest, and grow their company.

                                        Venture capitalists focus on specific industries; they can generally offer advice to

                                        entrepreneurs on whether the product will be successful or what they need to do to

                                        bring it to market. However, venture capitalists have a short leash when it comes to

                                        company loyalty and often look to recover their investment within a three- to five-

                                   <p>Through this process, a lender will front you the money on invoices that have been

                                        billed out, which you then pay back once the customer has settled the bill. This way,

                                        the business can grow by providing the funds necessary to keep it going while waiting

                                        for customers to pay for outstanding invoices.

                                        These advances allow companies to close the pay gap between billed work and

                                        payments to suppliers and contractors.

                                        By closing the pay gap, companies can accept new projects more quickly t to help

                        <p>HKSIG works with selected depository banks who offer the infrastructure that enables us to optimally manage investments for our clients. We cooperate with top-tier banks located in three of the most politically and financially stable countries: Switzerland, Luxembourg, Germany and Shangai.</p>
                        <p>
                        These banks are not involved in investment decisions. Our advisors independently select securities for our clients based on their specific financial objectives. Our partner banks do, however, provide enhanced benefits and competitive rates to our clients. We match each client with the bank that will meet their unique needs by estimating the number and type of securities necessary to successfully implement the strategy. We then provide the client with a quote regarding expected costs at different banks.</p>
                        <p>
                        HKSIG’s clients enjoy competitive and secure service with highly advantageous rights. Thanks to our strategic partnership with depository banks, we offer one of the leading platforms in deposit management – and our clients avoid the higher rates and fees of traditional banks.
                        To ensure maximum convenience, we open an account in each client’s name. This empowers them to actively monitor investments via secure internet access. In the initial stages of client engagement, we develop mutually defined contracts and investment frameworks, based on the clients’ personal and financial situations and goals. As their asset manager, clients grant HKSIG management authorization. This enables us to realize investment opportunities that align with and support their wealth management objectives.</p>
                        <p>

                <p>Online lenders have become a popular alternative to traditional Project Finances. These platforms have the advantage of speed, as an application takes only about an hour to complete, and the decision and accompanying funds can be issued within days. Because of the ease and quickness of online lending, economist and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said at the 2015 Lend It conference that he expects online lenders to eventually reach more than 70 percent of small businesses. </p>

                <p>Most of our clients prefer to increase their wealth through conservative, low-volatility investments. To meet their needs, we develop appropriate strategies, utilizing carefully selected investments. HKSIG follows a value-oriented investment approach with a strong focus on constant and predictable cash flow as well as an exclusion of investments that lead to loss of purchasing power.</p>

                <p>
                    Crowd funding can give a boost to financing a small business. They allow businesses to pool small investments from a number of investors instead of having to look for a single investment.
                    We ensure to read the fine prints of different crowd funding investors before any recommendation to clients, as some sites have payment-processing fees, or require businesses to raise their full stated goal in order to keep any of the money raised.

                        <p>Businesses focused on science or research may be able to get grants from the government. The SBA offers grants through agencies such as Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs and many others that are not publicly advertised. Recipients of these grants are required to meet specific government research-and-development goals, and have a high potential for commercialization and in addition to government grants, entrepreneurs can also apply for grant offers from certain banks, companies and nonprofits.</p>
                        <p>
                           Some programs even offer special grants for small businesses that are engaged in research and development
                        However, don't confuse a business grant with a loan,the difference between grants and small Project Finance is that grants generally don't require any major portion to be paid back, and are very few and far between.
