<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No, we do not act as legal, tax or other professional advisors. We strongly recommend that you obtain appropriate independent tax and legal advice.</span></p>

			<dd><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">What is your language of communication?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">All our communications are in English.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">My preferred language is not English and I want to receive a copy of the project finance application form in my preferred language and complete it in my preferred language. Is this possible?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Our project analysts only speak English, consequently our project finance application forms are only available in English and must be completed in English.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do you offer a translation service for my preferred language?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. It is your responsibility to arrange for translation between our English communications and your preferred language.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">What is the official language of your website?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">English is the official language of this website. The English version is authoritative over all versions of this website in other languages.</span></p></dd>

			<dd><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Would you like to be on our email list?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. All unrequested emails distributed via a list are automatically deleted from our system without being read. All emails sent to us but not addressed to us in the email ‘To:’ or ‘Cc:’ fields are automatically deleted without being read.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I have completed your online project finance enquiry form with a project which meets your criteria and I have emailed you several times but I have not received a reply, why is this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Please ensure that your email system will accept replies from us and that your email system is not rejecting our emails.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">We do not appear to be receiving emails from you, what should we do?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Please ensure that your email system will accept emails from us and is not blocking our emails.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I would like to email you some zip files or compressed files – where should I send them to?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">We do not accept unrequested zip or compressed files. All unrequested zip or compressed files are automatically deleted from our system and are never unzipped or decompressed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Would you like to join me on Skype, Facebook, Linked In, Twitter, Skoost, Netlog, Badoo, ICQ etc..?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Please do not send us invitations for these or any similar services. We are a professional organization and we do not communicate via these channels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I use Boxbe or a similar email spam prevention service, will you please verify your emails to me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. This adds to our administrative burden so we do not verify emails for services like Boxbe. If you use Boxbe or a similar service you must look in your waitlist for emails from us.</span></p>

       				<dt>TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</dt>
			<dd><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do your executives accept or return calls from unknown callers?</span></p>


<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Previously we were telephoned by applicants wanting to tell us about their projects many of which were clearly non-financeable or by callers trying to sell us office supplies or office cleaning, security, chauffeur, taxi, courier or other services. We therefore no longer accept or return calls unless it concerns a project which we have already evaluated and approved.</span></p>


<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Why is your telephone number no longer on your website?</span></p>


<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">We were receiving a large and increasing number of telephone calls asking for information which is clearly stated on our website, this resulted in us wasting a very considerable amount of time. To avoid this waste of time we now require all new applicants to complete our onli</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ne </span><a href="contact-us.html" target="_blank" style="font-family: Verdana;">project finance enquiry</a><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> form.</span></span></p>


<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I would like to telephone you how can I do this?</span></p>


<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Please complete our online project finance enquiry form we will email our response to you, typically in one or two working days and we will include our telephone number in our reply. Generally, however, we prefer to communicate in writing via email as this greatly reduces the possibility of misunderstanding and provides a permanent record of what has been said.</span></p>

Is this acceptable to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Our analysts do not have time to extract information from unrequested documentation. We therefore have the strict policy that we only evaluate documentation that we have specifically requested, so please do not send us documentation until we specifically request it. You must first complete our online project finance enquiry form.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Instead of completing and returning your project finance application form I sent you my feasibility studies, business plan or other documentation but I have not heard from you. Why is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Every day well-meaning applicants, who clearly have no understanding of the volume of applications we receive, send us a vast amount of documentation, unaware that we do not possibly have time to evaluate unrequested documents. We do not read or review documentation unless we request it and we do not reply to enquiries which do not fully conform to our application procedures. If you elect not to return our forms we will be unable to process your application.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">You have rejected my application but I would like to try to change your mind. Will you agree to discuss this with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. When we reject an application our decision is final. If we reject your project, it does not mean that your project is not viable or financeable, it only means that we do not wish to pursue it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I fully completed and returned the project finance application form some time ago but I have not heard from you. Should I email you or call you to check that you have received my form?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. When we receive your project finance application form we send you confirmation by email that we have received your application form and passed it to our analysts. We usually send this confirmation email to you within seven days. If you do not receive our confirmation email within ten days you should email us to ensure that we have received your completed project finance application form. If you have not heard from us after our confirmation email we have not yet decided whether we wish to proceed with your project or not. We automatically contact all applicants as soon as we have reached a decision. Please note that this can take several weeks depending on how busy our analysts are. Please do not contact us during this period, rest assured that you will receive our decision as soon as we have made it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I want to apply for project finance through you but I want to do it my way and I do not wish to follow your procedures. Are you interested in this?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Please note that we automatically reject all applications that do not fully conform to our project finance application procedures.</span></p></dd>
       				<dt>REPRESENTATIVES</dt>
			<dd><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Are you looking for representatives in particular territories?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Yes. We are interested in discussing representation in various territories. However, as our good name is involved, we are highly selective in who we appoint as our representatives.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">In which countries do you have permanent representation?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">We have permanent representation in a number of countries including China, Germany, Hungary, Hong Kong, India, South Korea, the Philippines, Russia and the USA.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">How long is the application process to become a representative?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">It typically takes many months to become our representative. We do not appoint representatives lightly. You must act as a broker first before becoming a representative.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I would like to be considered as a representative, how do I proceed?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Please follow the standard application procedure by completing the on</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">line </span><a href="contact-us.html" target="_blank" style="font-family: Verdana;">project finance enquiry</a><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> form</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">, for your project which you think will most interest us, indicating that you wish to be a representative. Also, please email a copy of your resume to </span><a href="mailto:enquiry@hksig.com." target="_blank" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: medium;">enquiry@hksig.com</a><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I would like to meet you to discuss the possibility of becoming your representative, where can we meet?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">We will be happy to meet you at a site visit. In the past we have held sometimes very lengthy communications with candidate representatives only to eventually establish that the candidate lacks the necessary experience of international project finance to represent us. This has resulted in a great deal of time being wasted. Consequently we now require all candidate representatives to demonstrate that they have at least one viable project before we enter any form of discussion. To do this please follow the standard application procedure by completing the online&nbsp;</span><a href="contact-us.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(20, 98, 140); outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">project finance enquiry</a><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;form. Please note that separate projects must be on separate forms. There is no need to divulge your client’s identity at this early stage, simply give your name (state that you wish to be our representative) and contact details in lieu of your client’s name and contact details.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do you have a work placement scheme?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Our work requires experienced staff which we recruit internally.</span></p></dd>
       				<dt>BROKERS</dt>
			<dd><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">What is the difference between a broker and a representative?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">A broker introduces project finance applicants to us but does not represent us. A representative introduces project finance applicants to us and also represents us.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I am a broker, do you pay commission to brokers for introducing projects to you?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Yes. We pay commission to brokers for introducing projects to us.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">How much commission do you pay to brokers for introducing projects to you?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">The amount of commission we pay to brokers is determined on a project-by-project basis and is subject to written agreement.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">When do you pay commission to brokers for introducing projects to you?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">The commission we pay to brokers is paid when we receive our success fee.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I am a broker and I would like to introduce you to some project finance applicants, how do I proceed?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Each day we receive many applications from brokers. In the past we have held sometimes very lengthy discussions with a broker only for the broker to eventually present us with a number of unrealistic, non-financeable low-quality projects. This has resulted in a great deal of time being wasted. Since we receive our commission only when finance is placed with a project, we have absolutely no interest in projects which we believe we will not be able to finance. Consequently <span style="font-weight: bold;">we now require all brokers to demonstrate that they have at least one viable project before we enter any form of discussion</span>. To do this please follow the standard application procedure by completing the onl</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ine </span><a href="contact-us.html" target="_blank" style="font-family: Verdana;">project finance enquiry</a><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> form</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">. Please note that separate projects must be on separate forms. There is no need to divulge your client’s identity at this early stage, simply give your name (state that you are a broker) and contact details in lieu of your client’s name and contact details.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I would like to be your exclusive broker for a particular region. Would you agree to this?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. We do not offer brokers exclusive regional rights.</span></p></dd>
       				<dt>RATES AND TERMS</dt>
			<dd><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">What are your loan interest rates?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Interest rates are determined by perceived degree of risk, market conditions, lender sentiment and other factors prevailing at the time of the loan agreement, therefore loan interest rates can only be determined shortly before the loan agreement is closed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">What is your loan repayment period?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">The loan repayment period is determined by a number of factors including project scale, projected return on investment and other economic indicators. The loan repayment period therefore can only be determined after we have performed a comprehensive project analysis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">What happens if I do not wish to accept any of your loan proposals?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">There is no obligation whatever on you to accept any of the loan proposals. You have the absolute right to accept or reject any of the proposals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do I have to pay a penalty if I do not accept any of your loan proposals?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. There is no penalty whatever if you prefer not to accept any of our loan proposals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Am I under any obligation to accept finance from you?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. You are under absolutely no obligation whatever to accept finance through us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">How do you obtain your fees?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">We charge a percentage of success commission fee on all finance accepted through us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">When do I pay you your success fee?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">At the same time that finance is placed with your project.</span></p></dd>
       				<dt>FINANCE PROVISION</dt>
			<dd><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">How are you able to provide finance with the prevailing financial conditions in the international banking sector?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Banks typically provide only a very small percentage of the finance we provide. We obtain our finance from sources other than banks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I do not own the land on which my project is to be built, I have no money to put into the project and I can offer no security, is it still possible for me to obtain finance through you?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Under current market conditions we are unable to provide project finance for projects in which the applicant has zero equity. Investors require that the applicant shares some of the risk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I have a time-critical project which will fail if it is not financed soon. Do you provide finance for time-critical projects?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. To ensure that we retain our lenders’ trust we analyze projects with great care to minimize their risk. This takes time so we do not become involved in time-critical projects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do you provide seed capital for projects?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. We do not provide seed capital for projects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do you provide Islamic finance?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Yes, we do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I am developing a project and I have a bank guarantee or similar financial instrument, will you provide me with project finance?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">We only consider finance provision for projects which fully meet our criteria. If your project does not meet our criteria we will not be interested in your project even if you have a bank guarantee or similar financial instrument.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I am not developing a project but I have a bank guarantee or similar financial instrument, will you provide me with finance?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Yes, we would consider.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">I am seeking finance for a non-profit organization, can you help me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Possibly. We are strictly commercial but we are prepared to assist non-profit organizations subject to our usual terms.</span></p></dd>
       				<dt>THE PROJECT FINANCING PROCESS</dt>
			<dd><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">How do you provide project finance?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">We form a syndicate comprising a number of professional international investors and lenders. From the investors’ viewpoint, the advantage of being a member of a syndicate rather than the sole investor is that it spreads the risk for the project and each investor can see that other investors have independently concluded that the project is viable and profitable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Who are the members of the lending syndicate?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">The syndicate is typically composed of a variety of investors including hedge funds, institutional investors, government investors, private investors, investment banks, investor groups, money market funds, mutual funds, pension funds and venture capital firms selected from our private database of professional investors and lenders. We have associates who are retained by national banks and financial institutions as project advisors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">When is the syndicate formed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">The syndicate is formed after your project documentation has been completed, verified and approved by us. This is in the form of debenture of 1st charge on all assets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">What happens after the syndicate is formed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">After the syndicate is formed we typically offer you a number of loan proposals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">How do the lenders know that the information in my project documentation is accurate and reliable?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">The lenders require us to independently analyze and where appropriate approve your project documentation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">How do the lenders know that your approval of my project is trustworthy?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">We are usually required to provide financial guarantees to the lenders to support projects approved by us. This is in the form of a debenture or first charge on all company assets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do the lenders require you to financially guarantee my project?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Yes. When we approve a project, the lenders usually require us to provide financial guarantees for the first three years of your project’s operation. If the project fails to meet its financial objectives as defined in the feasibility studies and business plan, the lenders are legally entitled to retain the guarantees we have provided in compensation. It is therefore essential that we have complete confidence in the accuracy of the project documentation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Am I required to supply the lenders with financial guarantees?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Yes. You are required to supply financial guarantees to the lenders.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do you guarantee providing me with the required project financing?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Every project has an element of risk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">What is the likelihood of you providing me with the required project financing?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">The likelihood of a project being financed depends on project viability, projected profitability, the quality of the project documentation, prevailing economic conditions and other factors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">How long does it take to finance a project?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">The time required to finance a project varies greatly from project to project and is primarily determined by the project’s scale, complexity, nature, marketability, the prevailing economic conditions and the readiness of the project to go to market.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do you act on my behalf or on the investors’ behalf during the project financing process?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Neither. We maintain very strict independence from you and from the lenders during the project financing process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Why do you maintain independence from me and the investors during the project financing process?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">To have the necessary confidence to invest, lenders must have complete confidence that we are presenting them with a fair, accurate, objective and independent evaluation of your project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Do you contribute to project development costs?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Lenders would not regard us as being independent from you if we took a stake in your project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Are you interested in entering a joint venture at the start of a project?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">No. Lenders would not regard us as being independent from you if we entered a joint venture with you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Will you invest financially in my project?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">If the lenders do not appoint us as loan supervisors we may join the lending syndicate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">When does due diligence occur?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;">Due diligence typically occurs at the same time as the project financing process.</span></p></dd>
