       <h2>The Role of Cyber Security</h2>
       <p>We live in an increasingly networked world, from personal banking to government infrastructure. Protecting those networks is no longer an option.
Cyber risk is now firmly at the top of the international agenda as high-profile breaches raise fears that hack attacks and other security failures could endanger the global economy.
       </p>
       <p>The Global Risks 2015 report, published in January by the World Economic Forum (WEF), included this rather stark warning: “90 percent of companies worldwide recognize they are insufficiently prepared to protect themselves against [cyber attacks].”
Cyber crime costs the global economy over US$400 billion per year, according to estimates by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2013, some 3,000 companies in the United States had their systems compromised by criminals, the Center reports.
       </p>
       <p>High-profile US retailers Target and Home Depot were among many organizations that lost customer data and credit card information. In other companies, cyber criminals stole money from accounts, carried out industrial espionage and in some cases even took over company systems and demanded ransom money to unlock them.
       </p>
<p>It’s not surprising that governments and businesses around the world are searching for better cyber defense strategies. The European Network and Information Security Agency held a cyber security exercise in October 2014, involving 29 countries and more than 200 organizations, including government bodies, telecoms companies, energy suppliers, financial institutions and Internet service providers.
The tests included simulating more than 2,000 separate incidents: denial of service attacks, website defacements, access to sensitive information and attacks on critical infrastructure. Software and hardware failures were judged the biggest security threats.
       </p>
<p>In February, President Barack Obama addressed the Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection at Stanford University. It was attended by senior US political leaders, CEOs and representatives from computer security companies, major retailers, law enforcement and technical experts, to “collaborate and explore partnerships that will help develop the best ways to bolster our cyber security.”
There is clearly still much work to be done, and the people behind the attacks have a significant head start. For those playing catch-up, cyber security has become a matter of urgency.</p>

       <h2>Cyber Vunerability is on the increase</h2>
       <p>
		Cyber crime is only likely to increase, despite the best efforts of government agencies and cyber security experts. Its growth is being driven by the expanding number of services available online and the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals who are engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with security experts.
<p>Technical innovation throws up new online dangers. For example, the migration of data to third-party cloud providers has created a centralization of data and therefore more opportunities for criminals to misappropriate critical information from a single target attack. Similarly, the emphasis on mobile services has opened up corporate systems to more users—multiplying the opportunities to penetrate security measures.</p>
<p>Applications that involve the collection and analysis of data in large quantities—so-called Big Data—put additional pressure on security managers. Mountains of sensitive data about buyer decisions, their habits and other personal information must be kept safe, but until recently security was not a top priority in systems handling Big Data.</p>
<p>The development of an Internet of Things, which enables communication between machines, raises the possibility of appliances being manipulated by hackers. The widespread use of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is only likely to boost the possibility of information misuse.</p>
<p>Much of the world’s critical infrastructure, controlling services such as power generation, transport and utilities, already depends on M2M. Protecting the networks that carry the communications that control these services is vital, especially since decision making is often done without human involvement.</p>
